# Soccer-Pass-Detection
The code in this repository implements the **PassNet** model, the **ResNet18 + Bi-LSTM** model and the **Bi-LSTM** model that uses data extracted from a pre-trained model as input.
Also, there is the **Pass Tagging Interface** code that allows a user to define the temporal window of the Pass event annotated by Wyscout.
